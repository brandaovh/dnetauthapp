<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>This web application project was built as part of my postgraduate course in Big Data Analytics at Georgian College. It combines concepts taught in the following .NET tutorials:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/secure-data?view=aspnetcore-8.0">Create an ASP.NET Core web app with user data protected by authorization</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-dotnetcore-sqldb-app">Deploy an ASP.NET Core and Azure SQL Database app to Azure App Service</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Use the Application</h2>
<p>The web application interacts with an Azure SQL Database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data.</p>
<p>Access to the database is regulated via a role-based authorization. Here's how the authorization and authentication mechanisms might work for each level:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>User:</strong> Users can view existing data stored in the database, submit new data and delete their own data.</li>
    <li><strong>Manager:</strong> In addition to the access level granted to users, managers can approve or reject existing data via the details page of each entry.</li>
    <li><strong>Admin:</strong> In addition to the access level granted to managers, admins can edit and delete any entry in the database.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, any new account created will have a user access level. To perform operations requiring admin or manager access level, use the following accounts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>manager@contoso.com:Passw0rd!</li>
    <li>admin@contoso.com:Passw0rd!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>ASP.NET Core:</strong> Used for building the web application.</li>
    <li><strong>C#:</strong> Programming language for backend development.</li>
    <li><strong>Azure Web App:</strong> Hosting platform for deploying the application.</li>
    <li><strong>Azure SQL Database:</strong> Cloud-based database solution for storing data.</li>
    <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> Version control system for collaboration and code management.</li>
    <li><strong>GitHub Actions:</strong> Automated workflows for continuous integration and deployment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Skills Acquired</h2>
<p>Through this project, I gained valuable skills in:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Deploying applications on Azure infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Managing and querying data in Azure SQL Database.</li>
    <li>Version control and collaboration using Git/GitHub.</li>
    <li>Automating deployment processes with GitHub Actions.</li>
</ul>
